# What is this project?

The project has a backend protion in the "backend" folder.
The backend and frontend are communicating with http requests.

## Development server

Before you could start a development server, you need to install the frontend and backend project dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
